# ShakespeareGPT

In this project, I build a nanoGPT that generates Shakespear-like text.
The code in the notebook is highly inspired by Andrej Karpathy's YouTube tutorial, the objective wasn't to build the project myself but to walk through his tutorial actively.
I have tried explaining every step in details, to have a better understanding myself, and perhaps to help others if anyone ever reads this.

## Overview

This notebook walks through:
- Building a tokenizer and dataset (Shakespeare text)
- Implementing a Transformer architecture
- Training a nanoGPT model from scratch
- Generating text from the trained model

Everything is implemented step-by-step in pure PyTorch, focusing on clarity and comprehension rather than performance.
